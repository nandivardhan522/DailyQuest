'''
Time Complexity:
O(n) â€” Each index is pushed and popped from the stack at most once, where 
n is the length of the temperatures list. Therefore, the overall time complexity is linear.
Space Complexity:
O(n) â€” Due to the space used by the stack and answer list, both of which can store up to 
n elements in the worst case.
