'''
Time Complexity:
    Iteration over the string: Each character is processed once. This takes O(n).
    Stack Operations: Appending and popping from the stack are O(1) operations.
    In the worst case, the stack operations involve copying strings for nested encodings. 
    This results in a time complexity of O(n Ã— max_k), where max_k is the maximum repeat count.
Space Complexity:
    The stack stores all characters and partially decoded strings. The space complexity is O(n).
